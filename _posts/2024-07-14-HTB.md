# My CPTS Certification Journey

<div style="text-align: justify;">
The **Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS)** course from Hack The Box is a comprehensive program that delves into every aspect of penetration testing (PT). It's designed to build and refine your skills, making it ideal for both entry-level and mid-level penetration testers. The course challenges you to not only learn new techniques but also to test and improve your existing skills. In this post, I’ll share my journey with the CPTS track, from the start all the way to the exam.

I subscribed to the CPTS course as a student, benefiting from the $8 per month student plan available to master's students like myself at Saudi Electronic University. I began my journey in March, dedicating about two hours daily to working through the course material and solving challenges. By approaching the course as both a learning experience and a fun way to test my PT skills, I found the journey more enjoyable and manageable.

The **CPTS** curriculum is thorough, covering critical areas such as:

- **Network Security**: Learning how to assess and exploit vulnerabilities in network configurations.
- **Web Application Testing**: Understanding common web vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, XSS, and file upload attacks.
- **System Exploitation**: Techniques for exploiting various operating systems, including privilege escalation and post-exploitation tactics.
- **Password Cracking**: Methods for recovering passwords from different types of systems.
- **Social Engineering**: Techniques to manipulate human behavior to gain unauthorized access.

One of the key takeaways from this course is the emphasis on real-world application. For instance, consider file upload attacks—how many times have you encountered a file upload function without fully testing its security? This course made me realize how easy it is to overlook such vulnerabilities, which could lead to high or medium-severity findings in a real PT scenario.

I completed the course path in about four months. One approach that helped me tremendously was thoroughly engaging with each module's content and completing the skills assessments at the end of each module. These assessments are critical as they allow you to apply what you've learned in practical scenarios, reinforcing your understanding of the material.

The CPTS exam itself is notoriously tough. It’s not just a written test but a hands-on practical exam where you're required to demonstrate your ability to solve complex security challenges within a controlled environment. The exam tests everything you've learned throughout the course, pushing you to apply your skills under pressure.

Ultimately, the CPTS certification is a significant achievement that validates your skills in penetration testing. If you’re considering this certification, I highly recommend thorough preparation, consistent practice, and a genuine interest in improving your skills. The knowledge and experience gained through this course are invaluable for anyone serious about a career in cybersecurity.
