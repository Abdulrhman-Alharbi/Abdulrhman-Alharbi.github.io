# My CPTS Certification Journey

<div style="text-align: justify;">
The **Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS)** course from Hack The Box is an advanced and comprehensive program that delves into every aspect of penetration testing (PT). It is designed to build and refine skills necessary for both entry-level and mid-level penetration testers. The course includes practical challenges and real-world scenarios that push you to not only learn new techniques but also to test and improve your existing skills. This post details my journey with the CPTS track, from enrollment to certification.

I enrolled in the CPTS course as a student, benefiting from the $8 per month student plan offered to master's students like myself at Saudi Electronic University. I started my journey in March, dedicating approximately two hours daily to working through the course material and solving challenges. Treating the course as both a learning experience and a fun way to test my penetration testing (PT) skills made the journey more engaging and manageable.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
- **Network Security**: Assessing and exploiting vulnerabilities in network configurations, including firewall rules, network protocols, and network architecture.
- **Web Application Testing**: Identifying and exploiting common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and file upload attacks.
- **System Exploitation**: Techniques for exploiting various operating systems, including privilege escalation, post-exploitation, and system hardening.
- **Password Cracking**: Methods for recovering passwords using techniques such as brute force, dictionary attacks, and rainbow tables.
- **Social Engineering**: Employing techniques to manipulate human behavior to gain unauthorized access, including phishing, pretexting, and baiting.

### Real-World Application

One of the standout features of the CPTS course is its emphasis on real-world application. For example, consider file upload attacksâ€”an area often overlooked in many security assessments. The course highlights how such vulnerabilities can be exploited and demonstrates practical techniques for testing and securing file upload functionalities. This hands-on approach ensures that you understand how to address high and medium-severity findings effectively.

### Completing the Course

I completed the CPTS course in about four months. An approach that proved immensely helpful was actively engaging with each module's content and rigorously completing the skills assessments at the end of each module. These assessments are crucial as they allow you to apply your knowledge in practical scenarios, reinforcing your understanding of the material and preparing you for the exam.

### The Exam Experience

The CPTS exam is notoriously challenging. It is a hands-on practical exam that requires you to solve complex security challenges in a controlled environment. The exam tests everything you've learned throughout the course, pushing you to apply your skills under pressure. It's designed to simulate real-world scenarios, ensuring that you are well-prepared for actual penetration testing engagements.
